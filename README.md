# -Automatic-Railway-Gate-Control-System-
The Automatic Railway Gate Control System automates gate operation at level crossings using sensors. It detects an approaching train, lowers the gate to stop road traffic, and raises it once the train passes. This reduces accidents, ensures safety, and improves efficiency by eliminating manual gate operation.
